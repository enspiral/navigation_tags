= Navigation Tags

Provides hierarchical tree navigation based on Radiant's site structure. Outputs navigation in the form of a -very flexible and CSS'able- unordered list.

== Usage

  <r:nav [root="/"] [depth="2"] [expand_all="true"] [ids_for_lis="true"] [ids_for_links="true"] [append_urls=".."] [prepend_urls=".."]/>

  Given this directory tree: 

   * Home
   ** About
   *** Contact us
   ** Blog
   *** First Article
   *** Second Article
   ** Catalog

  <r:nav /> would output a navigation list like: 

  <ul>
    <li class="parent_of_current has_children"><a href="/about/">About</a>
      <ul>
        <li class="current"><a href="/about/contact">Contact Us</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="has_children"><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></li>
    <li class="has_children"><a href="/catalogue">Catalogue</a></li>
  </ul>

  == Available tag attributes:

  * ids_for_lis: 	  defaults to false, 			enable this to give each li an id
  * ids_for_links: 	defaults to false, 			enable this to give each a unique id
  * root: 		      defaults to "/", 	      which page to start building the navigation from
  * depth: 		      defaults to 2,				  which will print out the first two levels of pages.
  * expand_all: 	  defaults to false, 			enable this to have all li's create sub-ul's of their children, i.o. only the currently active li
  * prepend_urls:   defaults to none        allows to add certain pages at the top of the list
  * qppend_urls:    defaults to none        allows to add certain pages at the bottom of the list
